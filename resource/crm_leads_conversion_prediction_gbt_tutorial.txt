This tutorial is for predicting CRM lead conversion with Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT) and 
ScikitLearn. 

Setup
=====
Make sure you have ../lib and ../supv directories with all the python files wrt where gb.py
is. The drive code is in gb.py. Configuration is contained in gb.properties

Input data generation
=====================
./sales_lead.py <num_of_leads > leads.txt
where
num_of_leads = number of leads e.g 5000

Convert categorical variables to dummy binary variables
=======================================================
./sales_lead.py genDummyVar  <num_of_leads> leads.txt > <output_file>
the file leads.txt was generated in the last step

Train model
===========
Set the following parameters in gb.properties. You could also change any parameter in the 
train group. 
common.mode=train

Run
./gb.py gb.properties

Train and Validate with parameter search
========================================
Set the following parameters in gb.properties. You could also change any parameter train group.
common.mode=trainValidate

If you want to do parameters search set the following parameter
train.search.param.strategy=guided

Set the list of parameters to be included in search as below
train.search.params=train.learning.rate:float,train.num.estimators:int

For each of the parameters, provide a list of values as below
train.learning.rate=0.04,0.07,0.12
train.num.estimators=40,70,120

Run
./gb.py gb.properties

Train and Validate without parameter search
===========================================
Set the following parameters in gb.properties. You could also change any parameter train group.
common.mode=trainValidate

Set the following parameter
train.search.param.strategy=_

Make sure all parameters have singe values, in case you ran train and validate with parameter 
search earlier

Run
./gb.py gb.properties
