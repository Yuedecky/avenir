This tutorial is for predicting CRM lead conversion with Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT) and 
ScikitLearn. 

Input data generation
=====================
./sales_lead.py <num_of_leads > leads.txt
where
num_of_leads = number of leads e.g 5000

Convert categorical variables to dummy binary variables
=======================================================
./sales_lead.py genDummyVar  <num_of_leads> leads.txt > <output_file>
the file leads.txt was generated in the last step

Train model
===========
Set the following parameters in gb.properties. You could also change any parameter in the 
train group. 
common.mode=train

./gb.py gb.properties

Train and Validate
==================
Set the following parameters in gb.properties. You could also change any parameter train group.
common.mode=trainValidate
train.search.param.strategy=guided

./gb.py gb.properties
